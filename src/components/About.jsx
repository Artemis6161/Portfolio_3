    Hello! I'm Sangeetha, a MERN stack developer with a deep passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered web applications.
        My journey into the world of web development was sparked in a rather unexpected place. While attending a free workshop on an entirely different topic, we were given a seemingly simple task: recreate the Google search page. What began as a curious exercise quickly ignited a passion within me. I found myself utterly captivated by the process of deconstructing a familiar interface and understanding the underlying structure. That initial task became a catalyst. I started researching, delving deeper into the technologies that power the web, and that's when I discovered the vibrant world of modern web development, particularly the MERN stack with React at its heart. The ability to build interactive and dynamic websites resonated deeply with my desire to create and solve problems. From that moment, I was hooked. I dedicated myself to studying, learning the intricacies of frontend and backend development, and building websites that brought my ideas to life. That simple task of recreating a search page in a workshop here in Chennai set me on an exciting path, and I'm eager to continue growing and contributing my skills to build impactful web applications.
    </p>
    <p className='font-sans text-secondary text-lg leading-relaxed'>
I'm looking for an opportunity to contribute to projects where I can help bridge the gap between technical implementation and great design, ultimately creating engaging and accessible experiences for users.
